# ESP-based-efficient-networks
Three network communication examples of ESP-NOW, BLE and LoRa technology using optimized energy-saving ESP32 and ESP8266

This repository includes construction of three star network topologies based on different ESP platforms. Each topology communicates via different technology. 

# Communication technologies
* Topology 1: ESP-NOW
* Topology 2: BLE
* Topology 3: LoRa
